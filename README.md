# Sign-to-Character-Conversion-in-Bangla
This project aims to translate silent language gestures (such as sign language) into Bangla characters using deep learning models. The model leverages image data to recognize characters from silent language gestures, offering a potential application in accessible communication tools.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
The project uses over 2,000 images of silent language gestures, which were manually collected and preprocessed for training the deep learning model. The model achieves 90% accuracy on most of the recognition tasks. It utilizes popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV to train and test models for character recognition.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used for this project consists of over 2,000 images of silent language gestures, collected manually. Data augmentation techniques were applied to increase dataset diversity and improve model performance.

<h2>Key Results</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Achieved 90% accuracy in character recognition and translation on most models.</li>
<li>Model trained using various architectures for optimal performance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
Once the model is trained, you can input images of silent language gestures, and the model will predict the corresponding Bangla characters.
